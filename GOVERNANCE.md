## 📖 Decision Log

### Feature: Production-Readiness Audit Resolution (Architecture, Reliability & Security)

**Date:** 2026-04-25
**Branch:** `feature/reconcile-architecture`
**Status:** Pending Peer Review

#### 1. Technical Decisions

- **Architecture Alignment:** Deprecated the simplistic 3x3 `analyze_board` function in `main.py`. The AI RAG prompt now natively ingests tactical data directly from the 15x15 `GomokuSimulator` engine, eliminating logical contradictions between the frontend and backend.
- **Strict API Contracts:** Enforced defensive programming via Pydantic. `ChatRequest` now mathematically guarantees the board array length is exactly 225, preventing malformed payload crashes, and defines a strict `ChatResponse` schema.
- **Reliability Engineering (Tenacity & Timeouts):** Implemented an exponential backoff retry mechanism (max 3 attempts) for the LangChain pipeline. Enforced strict asynchronous timeouts: 3.0s for Pinecone retrieval and 8.0s for Gemini generation.
- **Graceful RAG Degradation:** Engineered a fallback path. If Pinecone times out or crashes, the system catches the exception and bypasses external knowledge retrieval, relying entirely on the local heuristic engine to ensure the user experience remains uninterrupted.
- **Retrieval Optimization:** Adjusted Pinecone `top_k` from 2 to 3 to balance tactical diversity and latency. Injected the current tactical board state into the search query to improve embedding match relevance.

#### 2. Security & Quality Audit

- **SAST Clearance:** Ran `bandit` static analysis. Achieved a 100% pass rate with 0 High/Medium vulnerabilities across the codebase.
- **CORS Lockdown:** Restricted `allow_origins` from a wildcard `["*"]` to strict local and production URLs, preventing unauthorized cross-origin API quota consumption.
- **Prompt Injection Defense:** Fortified `ai_governance.py` regex patterns to actively intercept and block System Prompt Hijacking attempts (e.g., users submitting `[ROLE]:` or `[STRICT GUIDELINES]:`).
- **Observability:** Injected a UUID `trace_id` into the `/api/chat` payload. This ID is now passed back to the client and logged centrally alongside Telemetry (Mt) and Human-in-the-Loop (Hl) quality scores, enabling deterministic error tracking.
- **UX Degradation UI:** Updated the frontend `index.html` to intercept 503 (Service Unavailable) and 504 (Gateway Timeout) backend responses, rendering a friendly yellow warning UI rather than a raw console error.

### Feature: AI Validation & Assurance Pipeline (Governance Module)

**Date:** 2026-04-21
**Branch:** `feature/ai-governance-enhancements`
**Status:** Pending Peer Review

#### 1. Technical Decisions

- [cite_start]**AI Periodic Table Integration:** Engineered a dedicated `ai_governance.py` module to strictly implement the Validation and Assurance elements required for production-grade AI systems[cite: 353].
- [cite_start]**Red Teaming (Rt) & Input Guardrails:** Deployed regex-based pattern matching at the routing layer to preemptively intercept adversarial prompt injections (e.g., "ignore previous instructions") before they consume LLM compute[cite: 373].
- **Output Guardrails (Gr) & Policy Enforcement:** Implemented deterministic post-generation validation. [cite_start]The system mathematically verifies AI-suggested coordinates against the active `15x15` board state to suppress hallucinations, and strictly enforces a `< 80 words` response limit policy[cite: 372].
- **Metrics (Mt) & Evaluation (Ev):** Integrated real-time telemetry (latency, token estimation, cost) and dynamic response scoring. [cite_start]The system mathematically compares the AI's stated Win Rate against the deterministic frontend heuristic payload[cite: 374, 375].
- **Zero-Overhead Human-in-the-Loop (Hl):** Made a deliberate architectural decision to avoid synchronous PostgreSQL database writes (`FlaggedConversationsORM`) for low-quality responses. Instead, leveraged asynchronous `logger.critical` events. [cite_start]This allows seamless integration with external observability platforms (e.g., Sentry, Datadog) to trigger immediate alerts for the DevOps team without penalizing the end-user API latency[cite: 376].

#### 2. Security & Quality Audit

- **Test Coverage:** Created `test_ai_governance.py` to mathematically guarantee that all malicious inputs, coordinate hallucinations, and policy violations are intercepted. The pipeline achieved a 100% pass rate.
- **Fail-Safe Mechanism:** In the event of a triggered Output Guardrail (Gr), the system intercepts the erroneous LLM response and falls back to a safe, pre-defined apology string, guaranteeing zero hallucinated coordinates reach the frontend UI.

**Feature:** AI Governance Layer (Validation & Assurance)
**Date:** 2026-04-21
**Branch:** `feature/ai-governance-layer`
**Status:** Pending Peer Review

#### 1. Technical Decisions

- **Framework Alignment (AI Periodic Table):** Formalized the project's adherence to the "AI Periodic Table" by implementing a dedicated ai_governance.py module, specifically targeting Validation (Guardrails) and Assurance (Metrics & Evaluation).
- **Multi-Layered Guardrails (Gr):** Engineered a robust regex-based coordinate validation layer. Unlike standard LLM checks, this logic intercepts all letter-number patterns (e.g., Z99) to prevent out-of-bounds hallucinations and ensures suggested moves do not collide with existing stones on the 15x15 board.
- **Telemetry & Cost Observability (Mt):** Integrated a real-time tracking system to monitor latency, token consumption, and estimated API costs (based on Gemini-2.0-Flash pricing) for every interaction.
- **Consistency Evaluation (Ev):** Implemented a cross-reference auditor that compares the LLM's verbal win-rate reporting against the ground-truth heuristic data provided by the frontend engine, assigning a dynamic quality score to each response.

#### 2. Security & Quality Audit

- **Hallucination Firewall:** The /api/chat endpoint is now fortified. If the governance layer detects spatial logic errors (illegal coordinates), the system triggers a graceful fallback message instead of delivering erroneous tactical advice.
- **Unit Test Integrity:** Established tests/test_ai_governance.py with 100% pass rate on boundary conditions, occupied cell collisions, and telemetry accuracy. Verified that the regex broad-capture fix successfully handles unexpected LLM output patterns.
- **Audit Logging:** Implemented production-grade [PROD_LOG] markers. These logs provide a traceable audit trail of AI performance, cost, and reliability without exposing PII.

**Date:** 2026-04-20
**Branch:** `feature/core-engine-tests`
**Status:** Pending Peer Review

#### 1. Technical Decisions

- **Deterministic Testing:** Implemented a comprehensive `pytest` suite (`tests/test_ai_engine.py`) targeting the offline `GomokuSimulator` engine to ensure mathematical accuracy independently of LLM evaluations.
- **Coordinate Integrity:** Mathematically verified the `index_to_coord` translation layer to prevent off-by-one errors across the 15x15 (0-224) grid.
- **Heuristic Weight Verification:** Added strict assertions to guarantee the engine prioritizes lethal threats (assigning >= 10000 points to block an opponent's 4-in-a-row) and accurately evaluates offensive opportunities like "Open Threes" (~500 points).

#### 2. Security & Quality Audit

- **Algorithmic Confidence:** By isolating the engine logic from the API layer, we eliminated external variables, guaranteeing that the AI's foundational understanding of Gomoku rules remains perfectly intact.

### Feature: Controlled Continuous Deployment (CD Pipeline)

**Date:** 2026-04-20
**Branch:** `feature/controlled-cd`
**Status:** Merged

#### 1. Technical Decisions

- **Deployment Orchestration:** Transitioned from Render's native Auto-Deploy to a highly controlled GitHub Actions Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline (`production-deploy.yml`).
- **Pre-Deploy Verification:** Engineered a strict gating mechanism where the production codebase must first spin up a background FastAPI instance and achieve a 100% pass rate on all Pytest suites before interacting with the live environment.
- **Webhook Trigger:** Leveraged a secure Render Deploy Hook via `curl` to initiate the actual container build process only after the QA gate clears.

#### 2. Security & Quality Audit

- **Zero-Downtime Protection:** Disabled automatic deployments on Render. This guarantees that faulty logic, missing dependencies, or broken configuration files will fail the CI pipeline _before_ they can corrupt the live PostgreSQL database or cause a Cold Start Crash.
- **Secret Management:** Securely injected the `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL` into GitHub Secrets, ensuring no deployment credentials exist in the source code.

#### 3. Review Protocol

- **Primary Peer Reviewer**: Ruby (@xxandy-what)

**Date:** 2026-04-13
**Branch:** `feature/ai-chat-heuristics`
**Status:** Pending Peer Review

#### 1. Technical Decisions

- **Computation Offloading**: Relocated Gomoku spatial calculations (Win Rate estimation and Best Next Move prediction) entirely to the frontend (`index.html`) using a lightweight JavaScript heuristic engine[cite: 1].
- **Dynamic Payload Injection**: Bypassed the need to alter backend API contracts by packaging frontend calculations into the existing `last_evaluation` JSON dictionary. This payload is passed seamlessly to the backend during the `fetch` call.
- **Role Reassignment for LLM**: Shifted the Gemini model's responsibility from _calculating_ coordinates to _explaining_ them. The prompt now strictly enforces reliance on the injected frontend payload, drastically improving response accuracy and tactical value.

#### 2. Security & Quality Audit

- **Zero API Intrusion**: Mathematically guaranteed that no core application endpoints, database models, or API deployment configurations in `main.py` were broken or modified.

**Status:** Pending Peer Review

#### 1. Technical Decisions

- **ORM & Database Engine**: Transitioned from a hardcoded `MOCK_USERS_DB` to a robust relational database model using **SQLAlchemy** and **SQLite** (`tictactoe.db`). This serves as a highly portable local development setup, ensuring a seamless future migration path to PostgreSQL in production.
- **Registration Endpoint**: Engineered a new `/api/register` endpoint enforcing strict validation (Pydantic `EmailStr`) to prevent duplicate usernames and emails.
- **Frontend Auth UI Evolution**: Upgraded the authentication state machine in `index.html` to support a unified Auth Modal with smooth toggling between "Login" and "Sign Up" views. Successfully decoupled the UI from the mock data limitation.

#### 2. Security & Quality Audit

- **Password Cryptography**: Maintained strict enforcement of `bcrypt` via `passlib` for all new user registrations. Raw passwords are mathematically guaranteed to never touch the database or logs.
- **Audit Logging**: Enhanced server-side logging (`logger.info`) to explicitly track the exact identity and lifecycle events (`[SECURITY EVENT] New user registered successfully`).

### Feature: User Authentication & Zero-Trust API Lockdown

**Date:** 2026-04-03
**Branch:** `feature/user-authentication`
**Status:** Pending Peer Review

#### 1. Technical Decisions

- **Authentication Standard**: Implemented OAuth2 password flow with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to secure backend resources.
- **Zero-Trust UI**: Engineered a strict UI state machine. The game board and AI interfaces are completely hidden (`display: none`) until a valid JWT is detected in `localStorage`.
- **API Lockdown**: Secured FastAPI endpoints (`/api/chat`, `/api/generate-report`) using `Depends(get_current_active_user)`, mathematically guaranteeing zero unauthorized API quota consumption.
- **Vercel Deployment Hotfix**: Explicitly pinned `bcrypt<4.0.0` in `requirements.txt`. This resolved a critical serverless initialization crash (`ValueError: password cannot be longer than 72 bytes` and `AttributeError`) caused by `passlib` failing its internal wrap bug detection against `bcrypt 4.x`.

#### 2. Security & Quality Audit

- **Audit Logging**: Injected explicit server-side logging (`logger.info`) to track the exact identity of users triggering expensive LLM calls.
- **Environment Resiliency**: Upgraded `API_BASE_URL` resolution in `index.html` to natively support offline `file:///` protocol testing without triggering CORS/Network errors.

### Feature: AI Game Report System (Hybrid Intelligence Architecture)

**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Branch:** `feature/ai-game-report`
**Status:** Pending Peer Review

#### 1. Technical Decisions

- **Hybrid Intelligence Architecture**: Migrated from pure LLM analysis to a "Frontend Heuristic Tagging + Backend LLM Summarization" model. The frontend Minimax algorithm now silently tags every move in real-time (`evaluation_label`, `missed_best_move`), drastically reducing LLM hallucination and latency.
- **Dual-Format Data Export**: Established JSON as the application's internal source of truth, with a seamless frontend engine to compile this JSON into a downloadable CSV report for users instantly at the end of the match.
- **Environment Auto-Detection**: Implemented dynamic configuration for `API_BASE_URL` in `index.html`. It automatically switches between `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (Local) and relative paths `""` (Vercel Production) based on `window.location.hostname`.

#### 2. Security & Quality Audit

- **State Race Condition Fix**: Resolved a critical bug where the AI Coach was analyzing the computer's ('O') immediate response instead of the user's ('X') move. Replaced basic array popping with a reverse human-player search (`reverse().find(m => m.player === "X")`).
- **Data Contract Upgrade**: Safely upgraded the `Move` and `ChatRequest` Pydantic models in `main.py` using `Optional[Dict]` to accept the new heuristic tags without breaking backward compatibility or triggering `422 Unprocessable Entity` errors.
- **Rate Limit Mitigation**: Switched default LLM calls from `gemini-2.5-flash` to `gemini-2.0-flash` (or `1.5-flash`) for local development to bypass the strict 20 RPM Free Tier limits.

### Feature: 4x4 Board Expansion

**Date:** 2026-04-02
**Branch:** `feature/board-4x4-expansion`
**Status:** Pending Peer Review

#### 1. Technical Decisions

- **Algorithm Optimization**: Upgraded Minimax to include **Alpha-Beta Pruning** and a **Depth Limit (5)**. This was necessary to prevent browser hang-ups caused by the $4^4$ state space complexity of a 16-cell board.
- **Coordinate Mapping**: Shifted the win-condition logic from 8 patterns (3x3) to 10 patterns (4x4).
- **RAG Calibration**: Updated the Pinecone vector database. Deprecated 3x3 heuristics (e.g., center index 4) in favor of 4x4 strategic positioning (indices 5, 6, 10, 11).

#### 2. Security & Quality Audit

- **Prompt Engineering**: Refined system prompts to strictly enforce Player X's perspective and prevent the AI from suggesting occupied or illegal moves.
- **Code Quality**: All Python functions now include Google-style Docstrings for better maintainability.
- **Environment**: API keys are securely managed via `.env` and are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
